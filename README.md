## 🚀 **Introduction**

OpenFrogget is a powerful and easy-to-use cryptographic tool built entirely in modern C++20. Designed specifically for educational and experimental purposes, OpenFrogget provides cryptographic functionalities based on a custom elliptic curve known as **ECCFrog512CK2**.

This suite allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using a robust hybrid cryptographic schema, combining advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key exchange, with AES-GCM for symmetric encryption.

OpenFrogget is made fully open-source under the GPL license to encourage transparency, collaboration, and innovation in cryptography.

---

## 🌟 **Motivation and History**

In 2025, during a comprehensive academic exploration into cryptographic primitives, we developed an entirely new elliptic curve, **ECCFrog512CK2**, as a response to the growing interest in custom ECC curves. Unlike widely established curves (such as secp256k1), **ECCFrog512CK2** brings a fresh perspective, robustness, and increased cryptographic strength.

The development of OpenFrogget followed shortly thereafter, intended to provide a practical, reliable implementation that could showcase the security, flexibility, and performance of this innovative elliptic curve. OpenFrogget has been extensively tested for correctness, performance, and cryptographic reliability.

---

## 📖 **ECCFrog512CK2 Elliptic Curve**

**ECCFrog512CK2** is defined over a large prime finite field and carefully selected parameters ensuring:

- **High Security**: 512-bit prime modulus providing substantial cryptographic strength.
- **Efficient Computation**: Optimal parameters for computational efficiency and safety.
- **Verifiable Origin**: Curve parameters and generation methods are transparent and verifiable through public documentation and open-source implementation.

Parameters of the curve:

```
Prime modulus (p): 9149012705592502490164965176888130701548053918699793689672344807772801105830681498780746622530729418858477103073591918058480028776841126664954537807339721
Curve coefficient a: -7 mod p
Curve coefficient b: 95864189850957917703933006131793785649240252916618759767550461391845895018181
Generator point (G) and order (n): Securely selected and detailed clearly in eccfrog512ck2 implementation.

## 💡 **Core Features**

- **Secure Key Generation**:
  - Generate cryptographically secure private and public ECC key pairs.
  - Keys saved in a clear, easily recognizable PGP armored format.

- **File Encryption**:
  - Implements ECC-based ephemeral key exchange.
  - Employs AES-GCM for authenticated encryption.
  - Output includes ephemeral public key for recipient to reconstruct the shared secret.

- **File Decryption**:
  - Correctly and securely reconstructs ECC shared secret.
  - Authenticates and decrypts AES-GCM encrypted data.
  - Comprehensive error handling and integrity checks.

- **Key Verification**:
  - Validate the correctness of ECC public-private key pairs.

---

## 🖥 **System Requirements**

- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch recommended)
- **Compiler**: GCC (supporting C++20 standard)
- **Libraries**:
  - GNU MP (GMP)
  - OpenSSL (libssl and libcrypto)

## 🚨 **Security Warning**

While OpenFrogget uses strong cryptographic algorithms, it is experimental software intended primarily for educational and testing purposes. The ECC curve used (**ECCFrog512CK2**) is custom-developed and does not yet have extensive external security audits like more established curves.

**Use in critical security scenarios at your own discretion.**

---

## 🚀 **Future Plans**

- Provide bindings for additional languages (Python, JavaScript).
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Mac).
- Extensive cryptanalysis and security auditing for ECCFrog512CK2.
